P2P currencies, Digital Free Banking, and Better Money Labs Role in Moving Things Forward
=========================================================================================

As a response to 2008 crisis, Bitcoin peer-to-peer network was launched in January, 2008, which led to a lot of discussions and writings
done on rework of money creation, economic interactions, decentralization, and so on. Especially as since 2008 we are living through big shifts, geopolitically, geoeconomically, lifestyle-wise. Such shifts should inevitably cause changes in monetary landscape, now with mankind equipped with blockchain tech which allows for trustless creation of base proof-of-work assets, transparency of reserves and monetary expansion.

Still, after more than 15 years of explosive growth of cryptocurrencies space, there are a lot of unsolved problems in the monetary space which could be solved by cryptocurrencies, programmable money, tokenized real world assets, but they are still unsolved. We are going through
them below.

To tackle with the issues stated below, develop solutions, push for their adoption and so on, we establish Better Money Labs company and more informal Better Money Initiative around. Better Money will use Ergo, Bitcoin, programmable money techniques from Ergo, Proof-of-Work and a lot of research and developments in offchain protocols, algorithmic stablecoins, trustless derivatives, transparent on-chain monetary expansion etc. With that in mind, lets get back to the current state of monetary issues


P2P and Community Currencies for People and Machines
--------------------------------------

Peer-to-peer economic interactions, along with possible money creation are not useful in person-to-person setting, 
but also person-to-machine (agent), or machine-to-machine (agent-to agent). Digital communities were also not considered
much in community currencies research before.

We have variety of designs here, and working on some implementations, such as Git Circles, community currencies 
framework for open source communities, or Basis, offchain cash backed by onchain reserves.

Private Money and Digital Free Banking
--------------------------------------

One of the biggest trends in the space at the moment is to use "fast" centralized blockchain (or quasi blockchain), and do government
treasuries backed, trusted party issued stablecoins on top of them. Biggest stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, now hold 
more US treasuries than most of countries. 

However, the current scheme can be improved in multiple ways. With Bitcoin treasuries inevitably attempts to 
build stablecoins on top of Bitcoin reserves will be seen, and here algorithmic crypto-backed stablecoins will be useful. 
Programmable money tech can help with satisfying growing compliance demands as well as ensure privacy where it is needed. 
Instead of centralized blockchains, fast Proof-of-Work based protocols along with merged-mined sidechains could be used 
to minimize trust issues in transport layer for the stablecoins. Better Money Labs propose Braid, double merged-mined 
sidechain of both Bitcoin and Ergo, with superior programmable money characteristics, as a next-level environment for 
both algorithmic crypto-backed and trusted issuance and redemption based stablecoins.

Creating Money for the Real World Issues
----------------------------------------

For many African countries, typical monetary challenges significantly affect country's international trade, imports, 
exports, and foreign investments. The most critical ones are following:

* Fast and unstoppable depreciation of a national currency
* Shortage of USD and other globally recognized currencies for international trade
* High interest rates
* International trade disbalance
* Lack of confidence among foreign investors

However, considering unique richness of many African countries in commodities, most appreciated kind of money, historically, 
this status quo is just weird and unacceptable. Better Money Labs is focused on solving exactly those issues with modern 
blockchain technologies, tokenization and smart contracts. We appreciate deep research as well as solving real world issues. 
While others are working on "tokenization", we are looking further to build tailored financial tools and XXI century monetary 
systems on top of tokenized assets.
